# Homework 02

Finished all the `TODO`s.  

## Run the program
After getting into this directory, you can compile and run the program using the following command:
```bash
cargo run
```

The executable file `tetris` in the folder [`release`](./release/) is built on my WSL, and its information is listed at [`system_info.txt`](./release/system_info.txt). You might encounter difficulties running this program if your WSL setup differs from mine.

## A tip of downloading dependencies
Furthermore, downloading some dependencies may not be easy... You can try to change the source of `crates.io`. Please refer to [tuna's help](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/crates.io-index/) for detailed instructions.
